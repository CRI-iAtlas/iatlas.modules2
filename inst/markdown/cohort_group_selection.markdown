Lastly, select a Grouping Variable from the dropdown below. This choice will be used to divide the samples from the selected and filtered cohort into sample groups that will be used for contrasts and plots throughout the iAtlas Analysis Modules. If **Immune Feature Bins** is selected, the samples will be binned into a number of groups of your choice, based on the range of the selected immune feature. For TCGA, you can contrast samples with the presence or absence of a particular driver mutation using the **Driver Mutation** selection.
