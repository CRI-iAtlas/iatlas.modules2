Use this module to create your own custom cohort and to specify how cancer genomics samples are grouped and used for contrasts in iAtlas. You can also upload a file to specify the cohort and sample groups. When you are done, cohort and sample group selection will be saved, and used throughout iAtlas. **You can refer back to this module at any time to review or modify your choices.** A summary of your cohort and sample groups is shown at the bottom of this page.

You can also access the iAtlas data by querying our database. Check our Jupyter Notebooks on how to [query the CRI-iAtlas database](https://github.com/CRI-iAtlas/iatlas-notebooks/blob/main/querying_TCGA_features_and_expression.ipynb). Information specific to the immune checkpoint inhibitor data is avaliable in the [Immune Checkpoint Inhibition data available in iAtlas](https://github.com/CRI-iAtlas/iatlas-notebooks/blob/main/ici_query_iatlas_data.ipynb) notebook.
